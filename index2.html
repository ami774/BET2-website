                    <div align="left">
                    <p>Chronic non-communicable diseases such as diabetes are a pressing issue for society. More than one in ten adults in Hong Kong and mainland China have type 2 diabetes, with another 35% (388 million) in China classified as having pre-diabetes. According to clinical best practice guidelines, the first management procedure for a person newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes is an intensive lifestyle intervention programme of healthy diet, physical activity and smoking cessation. However, these programmes are often designed with standard economic models of behaviour which relies on the assumption of rational decision-making. It can be difficult for those that have developed chronic health conditions linked to their lifestyle. </p>
                    <p>Techniques based on behavioural economics have been used to improve adherence to chronic disease management but have not been tested at the early stages of disease, where there lies an opportunity to delay or reverse the onset of type 2 diabetes for newly diagnosed people undergoing the initial lifestyle modification programme.</p>

                    <p>A recent review of some small trials of behavioural economic-based incentives are effective in promoting health behaviours such as weight loss, physical activity, and medication adherence. To widen the scope of previous studies, we would like to further investigate the effects of behavioural economics-based incentives specifically on glycaemic control and lifestyle in adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.</p>
                    <p>In view of this, the School of Public Health of the University of Hong Kong would like to invite around 500 participants who have been recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes to participate in a 9-month randomised controlled trial starting in [May 2020]. Our aim is to investigate the effect of behavioural economic-based incentives against a control group receiving standard care on glycaemic control and lifestyle change, to compare and suggest ways to lower direct medical cost for treatment for diabetes in the public sector in Hong Kong. In order to show our great appreciation, free pedometer and blood tests will be provided. Each participant will also receive a gift coupon upon enrolment and completion of the study.</p>

                  <p style="text-transform:none;">
                    Ok, so donations. Many people love this service and to my surprise, many have actually asked to donate. In allgoodconscience, I can't on the one hand write about how awesome and cost effective Azure is then on the other hand askfordonations to fund it. It's cheap — I've got it covered.
                  </p>
                  <p style="text-transform:none;">
                    Let me instead talk about the sacrifices required to make a service like this work. It can be enormously time consumingandthat's the real cost here. Plus there are a few services I pay for out of my own pocket to make the magic happen. If you wantto kick in to help me cover those costs, that would be awesome. And no problem if you don't want to either; justshare thelove and help others make use of the service.
